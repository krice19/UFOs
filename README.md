## Summary
This analysis is a great start for building a dynamic webpage that allows for user interaction.  This analysis can be built upon to make it more efficient in the future.  One drawback of this webpage is that the large amount of table data is displayed all at once on the webpage, making it extremely long and crowded.  Additionally, users must know what data is available for filtering the table.  A recommendation to enhace this is to create more pages of the webpage, so data can be split up.  Another recommendaton is to design the filter section to give the users the option to what they can filter the table by.
